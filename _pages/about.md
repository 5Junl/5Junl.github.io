## About Me

I am currently a second-year Master's student pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering at **ShanghaiTech University**, supervised by Prof. Qian Wang (王乾) ([Visit Prof. Wang's website](https://qianwang.space/)).

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from **ShanghaiTech University**. My undergraduate studies were guided by Prof. Lu Sun (孙露) ([Visit Prof. Sun's website](https://lusun912.github.io/)).

## Research Interests

My primary academic focus lies in the interdisciplinary application of computer science principles to complex challenges within biomedical engineering. Specifically, my research interests center on developing **Computational Methods** for **Real-Time Image Quality Preservation** in interactive clinical systems, with a focus on addressing image degradation challenges during human-machine collaborative diagnosis and treatment.
